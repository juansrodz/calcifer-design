'@calcifer-design/ui': patch
---

Share one visually-hidden class across the library instead of copying the block into each component's stylesheet. `LiveRegion`, `Alert`, `Avatar`, `Spinner`, `StatusDot` and `DataTable` all used it, and `DataTable`'s stacked header had already lost four of its nine declarations — including the negative margin that takes the 1px box out of layout. The hidden elements' generated class names change; nothing in the public API does.
